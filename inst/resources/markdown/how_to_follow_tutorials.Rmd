Throughout this tutorial, you will encounter text paragraphs such as this one, containing explanations and instructions. In text paragraphs, R code is always formatted with a monospace font and surrounded by a box, like `this`.  

You will also encounter coding exercises in interactive windows, such as the one pictured below. You can write and run code directly inside these interactive window ![](images/one.png){width=0.3in} and then click on the "Run Code" button to see the results ![](images/two.png){width=0.3in}. You can reset the exercise if you get stuck ![](images/three.png){width=0.3in}, or can get hints or the solution ![](images/four.png){width=0.3in}.

In both text paragraphs and inside interactive code windows, whenever you see any code surrounded by `<angle_brackets>`, that always represents a placeholder, which you should replace with your own code.

You can leave this tutorial at any time: it will remember your progress when you return.
