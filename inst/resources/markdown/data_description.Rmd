We will work with real-world data collected as part of an ongoing oceanographic time series program in Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the East coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia:

The figure shows a map of Saanich Inlet indicating conventional sample collection stations (S1-S9). The data used in this tutorial (sourced from S3) include various geochemical measurements at many depths in Saanich Inlet. Samples were taken approximately monthly from 2006 to 2014, though there is much missing data to contend with.
