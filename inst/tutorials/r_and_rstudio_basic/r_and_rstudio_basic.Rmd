## A Tour of RStudio

When you start RStudio, you will see something like the following window appear:

![](/images/rstudio.png){width=100%}

Notice that the window has three "panes":

- Console (lower left side): this is your view of the R engine. You can type in R commands here and see the output printed by R. (To tell them apart, your input is in blue, and the output is black.) There are several editing conveniences available: up and down arrow keys to go back to previously entered commands which you then can edit and re-run, TAB for completing the name before the cursor, and so on. See more in [online docs](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/using/keyboard_shortcuts).

- Environment/History/Tutorial (tabbed in the upper right): view current user-defined objects and previously-entered commands, and access tutorials.

- Files/Help/Plots/Packages (tabbed in the lower right): as their names suggest, you can view the contents of the current directory, the built-in help pages, and the graphics you created, as well as manage R packages.

To change the look of RStudio, you can go to Tools &rarr; Global Options &rarr; Appearance and select colours, font size, etc. If you plan on working for longer periods of time, we suggest choosing a dark background colour which is less hard on your computer battery and your eyes.
You can also change the sizes of the panes by dragging the dividers or clicking on the expand and compress icons at the top right corner of each pane.

### Check Your Understanding

The command below is used to display the object `dog`. However, when running it, you get an error.

```{r object-error, exercise=TRUE, error = TRUE}
dog
```

```{r Tour, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Where would you type the command?",
    answer("The console", correct=TRUE),
    answer("The History tab"),
    answer("The Help tab")),
  
  question("Where would `dog` show up if it had been defined in R?",
    answer("The console"),
    answer("The Files tab"),
    answer("The Environment tab", correct=TRUE))
)
```

## RStudio Projects

When you create a project, RStudio creates an `.Rproj` file that links all of your files and outputs to the project directory. When you import data from a file, R automatically looks for it in the project directory instead of you having to specify a full file path on your computer (like `/Users/<username>/Desktop/`). R also automatically saves any output to the project directory. Finally, projects allow you to save your R environment in `.RData` so that when you close RStudio and then re-open it, you can start right where you left off without re-importing any data or re-calculating any intermediate steps.

RStudio has a simple interface to create and switch between projects, accessed from the button in the top-right corner of the RStudio window. (Labeled "Project: (None)", initially.)

Let's create a project to work in for this tutorial. Start by clicking the "Project" button in the upper right or going to the "File" menu. Select "New Project", and the following will appear:

![](/images/create_project.png){width=75%}


Choose "New Directory" followed by "New Project" and click on "Browse...". Navigate to your Desktop, and name the directory `<course_name> R`(replace `<course_name>` with the name of your class, e.g. `MICB301`) for this project.

After your project is created, navigate to its directory using your Finder/File explorer or the integrated Terminal in RStudio. You will see the ".RProj" file has been created.

You can open this project in the future in one of three ways:

- In your file browser (e.g. Finder or Explorer), simply double-click on the `.RProj` file 
- In an open RStudio window, choose "File" &rarr; "Open Project"
- Switch among projects by clicking on the R project symbol in the upper left
corner of RStudio


## R Scripts

R script files are the primary way in which R facilitates reproducible research. They contain the code that loads your raw data, cleans it, performs the analyses, and creates and saves visualizations. R scripts maintain a record of everything that is done to the raw data to reach the final result. That way, it is very easy to write up and communicate your methods because you have a document listing the precise steps you used to conduct your analyses. This is one of R's primary advantages compared to traditional tools like Excel, where it may be unclear how to reproduce the results. 

Generally, if you are testing an operation (*e.g.* what would my data look like if I applied a log-transformation to it?), you should do it in the console (left pane of RStudio). If you are committing a step to your analysis (*e.g.* I want to apply a log-transformation to my data and then conduct the rest of my analyses on the log-transformed data), you should add it to your R script so that it is saved for future use. 

Additionally, you should annotate your R scripts with comments. In each line of code, any text preceded by the `#` symbol will not execute. Comments can be useful to remind yourself and to tell other readers what a specific chunk of code does. 

Let's create an R script (File > New File > R Script) and save it as `tidyverse.R` in your main project directory. If you again look to the project directory on your computer, you will see `tidyverse.R` is now saved there.

We can copy and paste the previous commands in this tutorial and aggregate it in our R script.


## Variables in R

### Defining Variables

We use variables to store data that we want to access or manipulate later. Variables must have unique names.  

Without declaring a variable the sum of these two numbers will be printed to console but cannot be accessed for future use:

```{r novar, exercise=TRUE}
2 + 2 
```

To declare a variable, follow the pattern of: `variable <- value`. Let's declare a variable `total` as the sum of two numbers.

```{r d_var, exercise=TRUE}
total <- 2 + 2
```

We access the value of `total`:

```{r var, exercise=TRUE}
total
```

We can use the value stored in `total`:

```{r sub_var, exercise=TRUE}
total - 1
```

After declaring a variable, we can perform operations to change the value stored in the variable:

```{r sub_var2, exercise=TRUE}
total <- total - 1


total
```

Now it's your turn! Declare a variable `product` and set its value to the product of the numbers 3 and 5. Next, using the variable `product`, declare a variable called `difference`, whose final value is 8.

```{r product, exercise=TRUE}
# First declare "product"
product

# Operate on "product" to get 8 as the value for "difference"
difference
```

```{r product-hint-1}
# First declare "product"
product <- #your code here

# Operate on "product" to get 8 as the value for "difference"
difference <- product #your code here
```

```{r product-solution}
# First declare "product"
product <- 3 * 5

# Operate on "product" to get 8 as the value for "difference"
difference <- product - 7
```

### Check Your Understanding

Without running the code below, what is the final value of `x`?

```{r solve-x, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 2
x <- y * x
y <- x - 4
```

```{r solve-x-q, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What is the final value of `x`?",
    answer("5"),
    answer("10", correct=TRUE),
    answer("6"))
)
```

## Functions in R

### Overview

Functions are one of the basic units in programming. Generally speaking, a function takes some input and generates some output, in a reproducible way. Every R function follows the same basic syntax, where `function()` is the name of the function and `arguments` are the different parameters you can specify (i.e. your input):

`function(argument1 = ..., argument2 = ..., ...)`

You can treat functions as a black box and do not necessarily need to know how it works under the hood as long as your provided input conforms to a specific format.

![](/images/function.png){width=75%}

For example, the function `sum()` (which outputs the sum of the arguments) expects numbers:

```{r sum_function, exercise=TRUE}
sum(3, 5, 9, 18)
```

If you instead pass text as arguments to `sum()` you will receive an error:

```{r sum_text, exercise=TRUE, error = TRUE}
sum("Sum", "does", "not", "accept", "text!")
```

On the other hand, the function `paste()`, which links together words, does accept text as arguments. 

```{r paste_function, exercise=TRUE}
paste("Hello", "world", sep = " ")
```

### Data Types in R

You've seen that `paste()` operates on text while `sum()` does not. In other words, different functions accept different data types. In this section, we'll cover three basic data types: numeric, character, and logical. The function `class()` tells you what the variable's type is.

Run the code below:

```{r class, exercise=TRUE}
y <- 4
class(y)
```

As you can see, numbers are of type numeric. Now, run the next code block. Is the output the same? If not, what changed?

```{r class-string, exercise=TRUE}
z <- "4"
class(z)
```

When you put numbers and letters in quotations, the variable they're assigned to is of type character. If you write text without quotes, however, R assumes you're referring to a variable. Can you change the code so that it runs without errors?

```{r quotes, exercise=TRUE, error=TRUE}
a <- hello
a
```

```{r quotes-solution}
a <- "hello"
a
```

The last data type we'll cover is logical, which takes on the values of `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They are the outputs of logical statements:

```{r logical, exercise=TRUE}
0 < 1 # smaller than
0 >= 0 # larger-or-equal to
5 == 7.1 # equal to. Note TWO equal symbols.
"cat" == "dog" # you can also use this symbol to compare text
5 != pi # not equal to
```

Below, write two logical statements using the template, one evaluating to `TRUE` and the other to `FALSE`.

```{r logical-statements, exercise=TRUE}
# ... <= ...
# ... == ...
```

### Getting Help

You can get help with any function in R by inputting `?function_name` into the Console. This will open a window in the bottom right under the Help tab with information on that function, including input options and example code.

```{r eval = FALSE}
?read_delim
```

The **Description** section tells us that `read_delim()` is a general case of the function we used, `read_csv()`, and `read_tsv()`.  

The **Usage** section tells us the inputs that need to be specified and default inputs of read_delim:

- `file` and `delim` need to be specified as they are not followed by `=`
- all other parameters have a default value e.g. `quote = "\"` and do not have to be specified to run the function.

The **Arguments** Section describes the requirements of each input argument in detail.   

The **Examples** Section has examples of the function that can be directly copy and pasted into your terminal and ran. 

Another example from base R that may be widely used is the function `nrow()` 

```{r eval = FALSE}
?nrow
```

The **Description** section tells us that `nrow()` from a matrix or an array.

The **Usage** section tells us the inputs that need to be specified and default inputs of `nrow()`:

- `x` is the data matrix or array for which the user is interested in identifying the number of rows

The **Arguments** Section describes the requirements of each input argument in detail.

The **Examples** Section has examples of the function that can be directly copy and pasted into your terminal and ran.



Tidyverse is a wrapper for many valuable functions widely used in R. One of the examples from Tidyverse would be `select()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
?select
```

The **Description** section tells us that `select()` can be used to select certain columns from a parent dataset, or optionally rename the columns

The **Overview of selection features** section provides the user a list of operators and selection helpers to fully realize the power of `select()` 

The **Usage** section tells us the inputs that need to be specified and default inputs of `select()`

- `.data` is a mandatory input which refers to the parent dataset or tibble to subset from
- the helper functions and list of operators could be used to specify the columns to subset

The **Value** section describes an object integral to `select()`. A more descriptive account can be read in the help section

The **Method** section describes the implementation method of the function `select()`

The **Examples** Section has examples of the function that can be directly copied and pasted into your terminal and run. 

### Check Your Understanding

Pull up the help page for the function `mean()`

```{r mean-help, exercise=TRUE}
# your code here
```

```{r mean-help-solution}
?mean
```

```{r Functions1, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What types of arguments can be passed to `mean()`?",
    answer("Logical", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Numeric", correct=TRUE),
    answer("Text"))
)
```


## R packages

The first functions we will look at are used to install and load R packages. R packages are units of shareable code, containing functions that facilitate and enhance analyses. In simpler terms, think of R packages as iPhone Applications. Each App has specific capabilities that can be accessed when we install and then open the application. The same holds true for R packages. To use the functions contained in a specific R package, we first need to install the package, then each time we want to use the package we need to "open" the package by loading it.

### Installing Packages

In this tutorial, we will be using the "tidyverse" package. This package contains a versatile set of functions designed for easy manipulation of data.

You should have already installed the "tidyverse" package using RStudio's graphical interface. Packages can also be installed by entering the function `install.packages()` in the console (to install a different package just replace "tidyverse" with the name of the desired package):

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

### Loading packages

After installing a package, and *everytime* you open a new RStudio session, you need to first load (open) the packages you want to use with the `library()` function. This tells R to access the package's functions and prevents RStudio from lags that would occur if it automatically loaded every downloaded package every time you opened it.

Packages can be loaded like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

It is a little tricker to load Bioconductor packages, as they are often not stored on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) where most packages live. There is a package, however, that lives on CRAN and serves as an interface between CRAN and the Bioconductor packages.

To load a Bioconductor package, you must first install and load the BiocManager package, like so.

`install.packages("BiocManager")`
`library("BiocManager)`

You can then use the function `BiocManager::install()` to install a Bioconductor package. To install the Annotate package, we would execute the following code.

`BiocManager::install("annotate")`
Sometimes two packages include functions with the same name. A common example is that a `select()` function is included both in the `dplyr` and `MASS` packages. Therefore, to specify the use of a function from a particular package, you can precede the function with a the following notation: `package::function()`. 

### Check Your Understanding

After installing the `dplyr` package, you encounter this error:

![](/images/selecterror.png){width=100%}

```{r Packages, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Why did this happen?",
    answer("The function `select()` wasn't installed"),
    answer("The package `dplyr` wasn't loaded after installation", correct=TRUE),
    answer("The arguments given to `select()` are invalid"))
)
```
