\description{
Saanich Inlet, a seasonally anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island
British Columbia, is a model ecosystem for monitoring microbial community
structure, function and dynamics in relation to changing levels of water
column oxygen-deficiency extensible to coastal and open ocean OMZs. This data
set contains cruise 72 of monthly time series observations in Saanich Inlet
encompassing environmental sequence information. Sequencing data was
processed using the mothur_pipeline R Markdown file to bin the data into
operational taxonomic units and determine their abundance
(\link[=OTUs]{non-normalized data set}) and then normalized to 100,000
sequences for each sample (seed = 4832).
