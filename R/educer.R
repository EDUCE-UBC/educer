#' educer: A collection of tutorials on using R in Data Science.
#'
#' The educer package was created by the Experiential Data Science for
#' Undergraduate Cross-disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative at the
#' University of British Columbia. It contains learnr tutorials introducing
#' basic data processing and wrangling operation as a pre-class activity. The
#' tutorials use data sets for the water column chemistry and environmental
#' sequence information of samples collected in the Saanich Inlet, a seasonally
#' anoxic fjord on the coast of Vancouver Island British Columbia.
